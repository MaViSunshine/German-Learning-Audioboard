# German-Learning-Audioboard
-------------------------
This is a pictographic language learning soundboard.
--------------------------
It's meant to help practice and learn vocabulary.
Each screen will have about 21 cards on a topic.
Each topic will be links in the general starter screen of the same format.
---------------------
Hopefully the final product would be child friendly and accesible regarless of native language, due to the pictographic presentation of the cards.
-------------
Make sure the audio is on, and watch the demo for the numbers screen (video player is muted by default).
